# FP Fundamentals

As part of the some FP mentoring sesions we have developed a very simple project (in Scala, Kotlin and Swift) that basically shows how to express the behavior of your program using type classes: `Combinator`,  `Transformer`, `Lifter` and `Flattener`, which are basically a simpler version of `Semigroup`, `Functor`, `Applicative` and `Monad`.
